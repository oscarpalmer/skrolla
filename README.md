# Skrolla

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/skrolla.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/skrolla)

A tiny plugin for scrolling to specific places on a page. :cyclone:

## Getting started

_Skrolla_ is available via [npm](//npmjs.com/package/skrolla) and [yarn](//yarnpkg.com/en/package/skrolla), but you can just as easily download [the script](dist/skrolla.js) and then include it in your document. After that, all that's needed is to add the `[data-skrolla]`-attribute to clickable elements with its value pointing to an existing ID in your HTML. :sunglasses:

## Older browsers

_Skrolla_ uses a few things introduced in later version of [ECMAScript](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), so if you're unsure of what may or may not be supported, I'd recommend using [the script](dist/skrolla.babel.js) compiled by [Babel](//babeljs.io). :v:

## To-do

1. Docs & demo
2. More easings?

## License

[MIT Licensed](LICENSE). Skrolla is yours to tinker with, if you'd like. Have fun! :blush:
