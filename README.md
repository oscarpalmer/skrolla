# Skrolla

A tiny plugin for scrolling to specific places on a page. :cyclone:

## Getting started

_Skrolla_ is available via [npm](//npmjs.com/package/skrolla) and [yarn](//yarnpkg.com/en/package/skrolla), but you can just as easily download [the script](src/skrolla.js) and then include it in your document. After that, all that's needed is to add the `[data-skrolla]`-attribute to clickable elements with its value pointing to an existing ID in your HTML. :geek:

## Older browsers

_Skrolla_ uses a few things introduced in later version of [ECMAScript](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), so if you're unsure of what may or may not be supported, I'd recommend waiting for a newer release where a [Babel](//babeljs.io)-version is included instead. :v:

## To-do

1. Babel
2. Minification
3. Comments
4. Docs & demo

## License
